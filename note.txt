Feature Detection by Harris corner detector algorithm (Wikipedia)
    1. Color to grayscale
    2. Spatial derivative calculation
    3. Structure tensor setup
    4. Harris response calculation
    5. Non-maximum suppression

=> we display the keypoints using a custom drawKeypoints as the opencv version i installed has binding issue on that method

Feature Description
    1. Compute gradient matrix of the image (dx, dy, magnitude, angle)
    2. Iterate every key point of the image
        a. We get the 16x16 window of the key point
        b. we compute the rotation of the patch
        c. key_point_descriptions = compute_histogram(array of 4 sub patches of the 16x16 patch)
            (Each sub patch is 4x4 patch of 16 pixel, each histogram is 8 element array. (so total 16 pixels x 8 elements = 128)

Feature Matching
    1. Iterate every keypoint with its descriptor
        a. Compute SSD of key point with every other key point in other image
        b. Find 1st and 2nd Best Key point
        c. If the 1st best SSD / 2nd best SSD ratio is < 0.5 and best SSD is < 0.3
                We can add to matches list

    2. We sort this list with respect to there distance

=> display the best 25 matches using drawMatches function
